creates a retro board for users to join
server would create an auto-generated board id (4 digit unique number)

and this link can then be shared to users to join the board
by joining the board, users would essentially first get the data of the current board
and they can then post their own data on the board



on the client side the user needs to generate an random uniqe UUID which then needs to be saved in the cookie
and when the user is calling any of the API of the server, they need to have this userId present otheriwse the API would reject the request

There is a concept of Host, which the user who created the board is the host
they definetely can transfer the Host ownership if needed (there would be an api for that)



POST /retro-board
and redirects user to a different link for that specific board
also shows a modal for the user to copy this new link and invite users
{
  "userId": "user123"
}

once the response is present with the user -> then the frontend can redirect to this new board link
{
  "boardNumber": 2993,
  "boardLink": "https://aesthetic-begonia-c590c5.netlify.app/retro-board2993",
  "hostUserId": null,
  "userStatusMap": {},
  "notes": []
}


Response
{
  "boardId": "1234", // auto-generated unique board ID
  "boardLink": "https://stickypad.com/retro-board/1234", // link to join the board
  "message": "board created successfully! Share this link with others to join."
}


GET /retro-board/:boardId
essentially gives you the current state of the board (all the data)

{
  "boardId": "1234",
  "hostUser" : "user123"
  "userStatus": {
    "userId" : "in-progress",
    "userId" : "finished",
  }
  "notes": [
    {
      "id": "note1",
      "content": "This is a note",
      "column": "went-well"
      "userId": "user123" // the user who created this note
    },
    {
      "id": "note2",
      "content": "This is a note",
      "column": "can-be-improved"
      "userId": "user123" // the user who created this note
    },
    {
      "id": "note3",
      "content": "This is a note",
      "column": "action-items"
      "userId": "user123" // the user who created this note
    }
  ],

  // other board data like users, timestamps, etc.

}
